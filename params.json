Other goals of this package are to provide more data sets to the R ecosystem for beer analytics from *open government data portals*.\r\n\r\n## How to install this package?\r\n\r\nTo install the package type the following:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"ttbbeer\")\r\nlibrary(\"ttbbeer\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can install the development version from Github:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"jasdumas/ttbbeer\")\r\nlibrary(ttbbeer)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use this package?\r\n\r\nThe components of the package are a data set called `beermaterials` which includes the materials used by U.S. breweries during beer production as reported on a monthly basis to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) from 2006 to 2015. The other components of this package include **eight data sets** depicting the historical tax rate of distilled spirits, wine, beer, champagne, and tobacco. \r\n\r\nSeveral different types of data analysis projects can be conducted by using this data such as: **Exploratory Data Analysis**, and **Time Series Analysis**. The intended audience of this data is everyone but especially for those interested in open government data or beer analytics.\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndata(\"beermaterials\")\r\ndata(\"artificialcarbontax\")\r\ndata(\"champagnetax\")\r\ndata(\"spirittax\")\r\ndata(\"winetax14\")\r\ndata(\"winetax1421\")\r\ndata(\"winetax2124\")\r\ndata(\"beertax\")\r\ndata(\"tobaccotax\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jasdumas/ttbbeer/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).
