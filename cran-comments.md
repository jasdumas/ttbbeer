## Release Commentary

* 2016-07-03: Per reviewer feedback I'm am providing a different and valid link in the source section of the beermaterials.R as the original link produced errors. This new link actually supports the motivation for this data package as the page says the data is in HTML format when in fact the data is in PDF format. I have also reported a data issue to the data.gov site and request the correct format be specified on the site to eliminate confusion.
